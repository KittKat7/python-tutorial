# Python typing formatting
# variable_name: type = data
# The variable name is what you want to call the variable. Variable names can start with any letter, and can contain any letter or number, (and some other symbols in python, but it is best to use alpha-numeric characters).
# Python does not require you to set a type for variables, 'variable_name = data' is valid, the ': type' is optional anotation. Because of this, python is dynamically typed, meaning that the type of variables is dynamic and can change. A lot of languages, like java, are statically typed, which means that you must set the variable type, and it cannot be changed later in the program.


# Integers are whole numbers, either positive or negative. Integer is usually abreveated to int.
int_var: int = 12345

# Floats are numbers with a decimal point. Some languages also have double which can hold bigger numbers than float, in python, this distinction does not exist.
float_var: float = 123.45

# Strings are made of characters, for example text. Strings have either ' or " on both sides. (NOTE: in other languages, ' and " have different meanings, in python, that act the same)
str_var: str = 'This variable is a String!!!'

# Bools are either true or false. In python, True and False start with capitals.
bool_var: bool = True
